This is the third (and last) part of the tutorial series [How I work from home](/posts/work-from-home), in which I explain how to access your data remotely via different ways. In this part, I talk about the inevitable graphical access to your remote machine: the different approaches and their pros and cons.

# Remote graphical access

## First option: don't!

Redirecting all the graphical interface information (positions, polygons, actions...) through the network connection is usually more expensive than simply streaming the raw data to a local client, that's why I recommend the `sshfs` approach commented in [part1](/tutorials/remote-data-access) or even the remote analysis from [part 2](/tutorials/remote-data-analysis).

If you use `sshfs`, you can use your locally installed software to open and edit your remote files because they will _believe_ that the files are actually in your computer.

__Pros__

- You don't need to download the files beforehand (they will be downloaded eventually, but on demand).
- No graphical incompatibilities between systems. If the software runs with local files, it will run with `sshfs`-mounted files.
- No network lag between your actions and the calculations (file loading will take longer, though).

__Cons__

- If the files are very big and your connection is slow, the files can take a while to open.
- You have to install the needed software (viewer, editors, etc) in your home PC. If there are licenses involved, this can be tricky or even impossible.

## Second option: through SSH

If you have set up your SSH connections as explained in [part1](/tutorials/remote-data-access), this is the easiest solution and does not require installing anything else (_a priori_).

If you want to be able to open graphical programs from your remote machine (like a 3D viewer), simply add the `-X` option to your `ssh` command or `ForwardX11 yes` in the adequate `~/.ssh/config` Host entry.

At runtime:

```bash
$ ssh remote -X
```

Or in `~/.ssh/config`:

```
Host remote
    Hostname remote.example.org
    User robert
    ProxyJump gerard@gateway.example.org:22522
    ForwardX11 yes
```

Then, once connected, try to launch a graphical interface, like `gedit` to test basic 2D interaction or `glxgears` for 3D renders.

If it does not work (`empty DISPLAY`, etc), please check the [answers to this question](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/12755/how-to-forward-x-over-ssh-to-run-graphics-applications-remotely) in StackExchange for troubleshooting. If some parts of the interface do appear, but others don't (especially 3D renderers), this is a problem with the GL libraries - they might not match between remote and local, etc. Tricky!

__Pros__

- If you are lucky, very easy to set up
- No additional installations necessary

__Cons__

- If the connection is slow, the graphical information can take a while to be rendered locally, so sometimes is faster to mount the data `sshfs` and use a local program
- It it doesn't work out of the box, a lot of moving parts must be set up. It might be the SSH server, an incompatibility between remote and local libraries...


## Third option: through remote desktop protocols

If you really insist on having remote graphical access, though, there are more efficient approaches than straight X forwarding: __remote desktop solutions__. They will display your remote graphical environment (desktop and everything) in a dedicated window in your local machine.

They consist of a server that runs on the machine to be accessed (`REMOTE`) and a client that connects to the server from the machine we are sitting at (`HOME`). The server can apply advanced compression on the fly so it will normally feel more fluent than `-X`. There several protocols to do that, like VNC, RDP, NX or SPICE.

> __Servers__

> - NX-based: [NoMachine](https://www.nomachine.com/), propietary but free for personal use.
> - RDP-based: Developed by Microsoft, so you will use it to connect to Windows remote machines. In Linux, you can try `xrdp`, but VNC is better supported anyway.
> - Propietary ones, like [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com).
>
> I personally use NoMachine because it feels more fluent in my setup, but YMMV.
>
> __Clients__
>
> Simply put: use [Remmina](https://remmina.org/) to set up the connection. It supports almost every protocol and server, thanks to its plugin system. But if it does not work in your system, try with the _official_ client of the chosen server.

__Pros__

- Better performance
- Feels like sitting at the remote desktop if there is no network lag

__Cons__

- Elevated privileges needed for installation
- If the connection is slow, it will feel jumpy

You will have to ask your IT admin to install the server in your remote computer if you don't have superuser permissions.

## How to connect to a remote desktop

### General approach

Assuming the server has been properly set up in the `REMOTE` computer, you only need to install Remmina in your local computer `HOME`:

```bash
# For Ubuntu
sudo apt install remmina
# For Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S remmina
```

Remmina provides a graphical interface to set everything up! You just need to provide the protocol that the remote server is using and its address and port. Even if `REMOTE` is behind a gateway, you can set up an SSH tunnel in the same configuration dialog.

### NoMachine only

In some systems, Remmina will not work for some protocols (Wayland and NX, for example). So to access your NoMachine server in `REMOTE` you will have to use the official NoMachine client. Both are installed with the same package:

```bash
# Ubuntu
sudo apt install nomachine
# Arch Linux
yaourt -S nomachine
```

You can then open the client and create new connection using the `New` button in the top (if it is not already appearing automatically).

If you have __direct access__, it will be easy. For the `REMOTE` machine in [part 1](/tutorials/remote-data-access#get-access-through-a-gateway):

- Protocol: `NX`
- Host: `remote.example.org`
- Port: `4000`
- User: `robert`
- Password: `**********`
- Don't use a proxy

But if you have to jump through a gateway, you will need a port forwarding first. Let's assume the same `HOME -> GATEWAY -> REMOTE` situation as in [part 1](/tutorials/remote-data-access#get-access-through-a-gateway).

```
                                          |
                                          |
[HOME] ---(ssh)---> [GATEWAY] ---(ssh)---> [REMOTE]
                                          |
                                          | firewall
```


Then, you create the tunnel:

```bash
$ ssh -J gerard@gateway.example.org:22522 robert@remote.example.org   -NfL 4003:localhost:4000
#        \________gateway jump__________/ \____remote server______/ new port__/           \_NoMachine server port
```
> Take into account that you will need to create the tunnel everytime your `HOME` machine reboots, so consider creating an `alias` or a [`~/.ssh/config` entry](/tutorials/remote-data-access#from-bash-aliases-to-the-SSH-config-file).

With that command, the `REMOTE` NoMachine server is now available at `localhost:4003`. A new connection can appear now in the GUI automatically, but it doesn't normally work. Just in case, create a new one named `RemotePC over SSH` or something like that with these parameters:

- Protocol: `NX`
- Host: `localhost`
- Port: `4003`
- User: `robert`
- Password: `**********`
- Don't use a proxy

Double click on the connection, enter the login details, click OK and...

Voil√†!
