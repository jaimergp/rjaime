Due to my PhD thesis, I am mostly concerned with molecular modelling software and the Python language. However, from time to time I also code something using other languages, like JavaScript.

> Update 2025: This used to be a page where I was supposed to add any new software projects I was involved with. I didn't fulfil that purpose so what you see below is just a collection of the things I wrote during my PhD (until the end of 2018).

## Alpha

These projects are under heavy development, so they might break from time to time as they are improved. Use with care!

- [Tangram](http://github.com/insilichem/tangram): A set of [UCSF Chimera](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/) extensions for molecular modelling.
- [DMV](https://github.com/jaimergp/dmv): An web-based molecule viewer based on NGL for Google products, like Drive or Gmail. Check it at [dmv.insilichem.com](http://dmv.insilichem.com/).
- [fixbibtex](https://github.com/jaimergp/fixbibtex): An async script to fix `*.bib` bibliography entries using the CrossRef API.

## Beta

Feel free to use these programs, but please report any problems that you might find. They are feature stable, but some bugs may arise.

- [GaudiMM](http://github.com/insilichem/gaudi): A multi-objective optimization platform for molecular modeling and sketching.
- [OMMProtocol](http://github.com/insilichem/ommprotocol). A command-line application for OpenMM.
- [ESIgen](http://github.com/insilichem/esigen). An online supporting information generator for computational chemistry logfiles. Check it at [esi.insilichem.com](http://esi.insilichem.com/) (please wait a few seconds while Heroku boots!).
- [GARLEEK](http://github.com/insilichem/garleek): Extend Gaussian's ONIOM with Tinker force fields.
- [EasyMECP](https://github.com/jaimergp/easymecp): MECP calculations with Gaussian as easy as possible.
- [PyChimera](http://github.com/insilichem/pychimera): Use UCSF Chimera modules in any Python 2.7 project.

Other projects are also listed in [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/jaimergp). I will be updating this post with new information as needed.
