Hi, I am Jaime.

I like to write about technical tips, music and the projects I am currently working on. You can follow me on:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/jaimergp): For my open-source software contributions. Check [Projects](/projects/) for a brief overview.
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jaime_rgp): Mostly focused on my academic career. I have authored several [articles, reviews and book chapters](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=imKyayEAAAAJ).
- [Instagram](https://instagram.com/jaime.six): The music I make and play! Maybe some travelling, maybe some friends.
