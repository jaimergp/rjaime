Hi, I am Jaime. Pronounced `/Ëˆxaime/` or _hi-meh_.

I like to write about technical tips, music, and the projects I am currently working on. You can also follow me on:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/jaimergp): For my open-source software contributions.
- [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/rjai.me): For informal comments about tech and low-effort updates on open-source.
- In my past academic life, I also authored several [articles, reviews and book chapters](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=imKyayEAAAAJ).
